Check the spelling: SQL is case-sensitive, ensure that the column name is spelled correctly.\n2. Check the case: Many databases are case-sensitive. If the column name was created with double quotes (\"team_name\"), then it will be case-sensitive, and you will need to query with double quotes.\n3. Check the table structure: Use a DESCRIBE statement or similar to check what columns exist in your table.\n4. Check the right table: Make sure you're querying the correct table where the column exists.\n5. Check with your database administrator or look at the database schema to verify whether such a column exists or not."
